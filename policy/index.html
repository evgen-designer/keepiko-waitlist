        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        
        <h2>Your privacy is my priority</h2>
        <p>I want you to feel safe using Keepiko. This policy explains what data the app uses and, more importantly, what it doesn't do.</p>
        
        <h2>Who I am</h2>
        <p>
            <strong>App:</strong> Keepiko<br>
            <strong>Creator:</strong> IEVGEN KUZNIETSOV<br>
            <strong>Contact:</strong> keepiko.info@gmail.com
        </p>
        
        <h2>Your Data Stays On Your Device</h2>
        <p>I designed Keepiko to be a private, offline-first app. All the information you enter—your rooms, spaces, boxes, items, and photos—is stored only on your device using Apple's secure SwiftData framework.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I do not have servers that collect your inventory data.</li>
            <li>I cannot see what you've stored or look at your photos.</li>
            <li>If you delete the app, all of its data is deleted from your device.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Backups</h2>
        <p>You have the option to create a backup of your data. This backup file is saved to a location you choose (like iCloud Drive or your computer) and remains completely under your control. I never have access to it.</p>
        
        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>To provide certain features, I use a few trusted third-party services. These services have their own privacy policies and only have access to the specific data they need to function. They never have access to your inventory data.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Apple:</strong> Handles all payment processing for Keepiko Plus subscriptions securely. I never see your payment information.</li>
            <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> Helps me verify your subscription status (e.g., to unlock Plus features) and restore your purchases. To do this, RevenueCat uses an anonymous User ID and your Purchase History.</li>
            <li><strong>WishKit:</strong> Allows you to submit feature requests and feedback. To manage your suggestions, WishKit uses an anonymous User ID. You may optionally provide your Email Address so I can contact you about your feedback.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Anonymous Diagnostics</h2>
        <p>To find and fix bugs, the app may collect anonymous Crash Data and Performance Data. This information is not linked to your identity and helps me improve the app's stability and performance.</p>
        
        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>Keepiko is not directed to children under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.</p>
        
        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>If I make changes to this policy, I'll update this page and change the date below.</p>
        <p>If you have any questions about your privacy, please don't hesitate to email me.</p>
